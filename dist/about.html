          <p>
            I am now 31 years old, and I am just at the start of what will be a
            great journey. Today I would have been at least 5 - 6 years
            experienced in the Tech industry. You see, I dropped out of college
            in 2011 during my 2nd year. I was doing BSc Computer Science degree
            program with the University of Zimbabwe. This was due to
            circumstances beyond my control. But I did not throw away my dreams.
            Down the line, I enrolled with UNISA (BSc Informatics) through the
            e-learning platform. Again, I dropped out due to lack of access to
            resources. From the period of 2011 to 2015 I was working in the tech
            but did not have the opportunity to advance my studies.
          </p>
          <p>
            September 2015 I moved to South Africa, Cape Town, in search for
            greener pastures. I got a job in hospitality, where I am currently
            attached, as a waiter. From 2018 to current date, through hard work
            and sacrifices, I have been enhancing my skills through different
            online platforms. So as I stand today, I look forward to venture
            fully into tech industry and improve my skills to become better and
            also to utilize my current skills in the development of modern tech.
